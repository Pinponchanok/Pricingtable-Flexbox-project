# Pricingtable-Flexbox-project
This week, I learned about using Flexbox to create a responsive website. I use Flexbox to create boxes for each content and make them in the center of the browser window and place them evenly horizontally. Decorate them and adjust font, text size, and text align. I also use Media quarries to make them suitable for small browser windows.
